The human cognitive engine is very robust, meanwhile even insect cognition exceeds that of many ML systems. Some ML solutions can now exceed human ability for specific tasks, but are these algorithms are very fragile.  How do we bridge this gap?

CNN, RNN and Reinforcement architectures are now outperforming humans on image tasks and in specific domains. Machine translation performance without 'understanding' has improved dramatically.  Yet these systems are fragile like jet engine vanes to their data.  Witness adversarial images which can reclassify an image by manipulating pixel data a human does not perceive.

Human perceptions have their own bias' and flaws, however millenia have formed contextually aware systems.  Without contextual state management and the continuity of consciousness can we hope to approach the 'AI-complete' problem of language understanding?

The expert systems of the 80's attempted a reduction of human tasks to symbolic logic and are now all but forgotten, how do we ensure this is not the fate of the current Machine Learning resurgence?

Gerald Sussman is a key proponent of [Robust system design](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6.945/readings/robust-systems.pdf) but the approach does not come without cost.  Maintaining state is a significant overhead, but one nature considers worthwhile.  [Evolutionary Modularity](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1755/20122863) arose for a reason and is already optimised for cost.

When thinking about copying natural systems it brings images of Icarus to mind. For centuries humans tried to copy the flight of bird, focusing on the flapping of the wing, rather than its shape.  Machine Learning systems do not need to work like the human brain, but it feels like we are still missing an obvious detail.
