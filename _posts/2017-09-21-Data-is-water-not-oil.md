Hype is part of most marketing plans, creating a need for products and services - AI Hype likes comparing data with oil.  Making comparisions with other valuable resources implies great value in driling for insight in the data.  If data is oil then at best it is expensive shale oil and at worst worthless snake oil.

If an analogy for Data is needed then the most fitting is not Oil, but Water. Data is abundant and freely available, it comes in 'lakes' and 'oceans', doesn't take millenia to create, is a processed and public utility yet many pay money for it to be delivered to them in branded bottles.

This abundance belies the difficulty with Data.  If it is so freely available then why are machine learning solutions so difficult and expensive to implement?

The answer lies in the similarities with water.  What ML algorithms need is drinking water, and like drinking water, thats not what is freely available.  Sea water, dirty water, data polluted by our processing of it.

Solutions to clean structured data are analogous:

* **Collect it**: Like rainwater, clean data falls from the sky and if you have the foresight to collect and segregate it before it is needed then analytics is straightforward. This results in instantly structured data at the marginal cost of storage. Not building your future projects in a manner that stores the data is flushing this data down the toilet.

* **Keep it Clean**: Once you have clean data, don't pollute it.  That includes by refining it - what you throw away will prove to be the essential field to your future ML ambitions. Drinking distilled water is not good for you and this is true of data too.

or

* **Clean it**: Drinking sea water is bad, and making it drinkable is costly. Just because it is abundant, you are fooling yourself if you think the data is free.  Pre processing is essential, time consuming, and the bulk of your ML project cost. The infrastructure behind the water that comes out of your tap is running all the time, requires constant maintenance and upgrades, and a lot of the time amounts to paying a third party to collect the rainwater.

There is a reason ML algorithms are at their most powerful in online environments,and that arises from the naturally structured information created by online interactions.  Every interaction has to be handled by the site provider, and logging those interactions has always been a standard part of debugging and fault finding.  Logging was designed from the outset to be efficient and these logs can then be analysed for statistical relationships.

Scientific and Engineering applications offer the same benefits.  Sensors produce reliably structured data in the absence of faults.  None of this is true of our real world C2B and B2B interactions or transactions.  To reconstruct this interaction data from what data has been collected is a complex problem requiring sophisticad ML and inference.

Given the length of time technology provision takes in large firms, making the one low cost decision to collect data will likely show rewards before the grand drilling platform has been built.

There is no Return on Investment for this solution today, or tomorrow, but in a year, the collected data will allow solutions to problems that the business may not even be aware of today.

Recognising that collecting the rainwater will provide abundance in the future is a key lesson for any company wishing to maintain its current success.

And all just for putting a bucket out. Start Today.
