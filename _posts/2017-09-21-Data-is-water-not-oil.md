Hype is part of most marketing plans, creating a need for products and services - AI hype likes comparing data with oil.  Making comparisons with other valuable resources implies great value in drilling for insights in the data.  We would agree data is a valuable resource, but the resource it has most in common with isn't oil.

If data so freely available then why are machine learning solutions so difficult and expensive to implement? The answer lies in similarities to water.

The comparision goes well beyond data 'lakes'. Like water, data is abundant and freely available, doesn't take millennia to create, is available as a processed and public utility yet many pay money for it to be delivered to them in branded bottles.  Like water, much of the data is polluted immediately after it springs into existance, dirty as a result of its journey to the user, or the methods used to collect it.

What ML algorithms need is clean drinking water.

Like sea water the abundance of data belies that without treatment and processing most of the water in the world is useless. Turning dirty water into drinking water is large scale industrial task, drinking water isn't freely available.

To solve the problem of how to easily obtain clean, structured data, we draw the following analogies with
water processing:

* **Collect it clean**: Like rainwater, clean data falls from the sky and if you have the foresight to collect and segregate it before it is needed then analytics is straightforward. This results in instantly structured data at the marginal cost of storage. Not building your future projects in a manner that correctly collects and stores data is akin to flushing it down the toilet.

* **Keep it clean**: Once you have clean data, don't pollute it.  That includes by [refining it](https://www.insidescience.org/news/scientists-are-running-out-space-climate-data){:target="_blank"} - what you throw away may prove to be essential to your future ML ambitions. Drinking distilled water is not good for you and this is true of data too.

or else:

* **Purification**: Drinking sea water is bad, and making it drinkable is costly. Just because it is abundant, you are fooling yourself if you think data is free.  Preprocessing is essential, time consuming, and the bulk of your ML project cost. The infrastructure behind the water that comes out of your tap is running all the time, requires constant maintenance and upgrades, and a lot of the time amounts to paying a third party to collect the rainwater.

There is a reason ML algorithms are at their most powerful in online environments, and that arises from the naturally structured information created by online interactions.  Every interaction has to be handled by the site provider, and logging those interactions has always been a standard part of debugging and fault finding.  Logging was designed from the outset to be efficient and these logs can then be analysed for statistical relationships.

Scientific and engineering applications offer the same benefits.  Sensors produce reliably structured data in the absence of faults.  None of this is true of our real world C2B and B2B interactions or transactions.  To reconstruct this interaction data from what has been collected is a complex problem requiring sophisticated ML and inference.

Given the length of time technology provision takes in large firms, making the one low cost decision to collect data will likely show rewards before the grand drilling platform has been built.  The Return on Investment for this solution doesn't appear today, or tomorrow, but in a year the collected data will allow analysis, and in two, the solution to problems that the business may not be aware of today.

Recognising that collecting the rainwater will provide abundance in the future is a key lesson for any company wishing to maintain its current success...

...and all just for putting a bucket out.
